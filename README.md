# 🦠 Infectious Disease Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes infectious disease data from **2001–2014**, focusing on statistical analysis, visualization, and modeling of disease patterns. The analysis includes demographic trends, geographical distribution, time series forecasting, and epidemiological modeling to understand disease dynamics and evaluate public health policies.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The primary dataset used is **`Infectious Disease 2001-2014.csv`**, which contains information about various infectious diseases, including:

* 🧬 Disease name
* 📅 Year of occurrence
* 🗺️ County
* 👥 Population
* 🧮 Count of cases
* 📊 Rate of infection
* 🚻 Sex (demographic data)
* 📈 Confidence intervals (`CI.lower`, `CI.upper`)

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation

* 🕳️ Handling missing values and duplicates
* 🔄 Data transformation and standardization
* 🧼 Creation of a cleaned dataset

### 📊 Statistical Analysis

* ❗ **Outlier Detection**: Using Z-score methodology to identify potential outliers in disease count and rate
* 🔗 **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between population size and disease rates
* ✅ **Confidence Interval Analysis**: Evaluating statistical reliability of disease rate estimates

### 🚻 Demographic Analysis

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Analysis of disease patterns by gender
* 🔝 Identification of top 5 diseases affecting each gender
* 📉 Visualization of demographic trends

### 🗺️ Geographic Analysis

* 🧭 Mapping disease prevalence across counties
* 🌡️ Heatmap visualization of top diseases per county
* 🧭 Regional pattern identification

### ⏳ Temporal Analysis

* 📆 Yearly trends of infectious diseases (2001–2014)
* 🏆 Identification of top 3 diseases by year
* 📈 Visualization of disease count changes over time

### 🔮 Forecasting

* 📉 Time series decomposition using **STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess)**
* 📈 Forecasting future disease rates (example with Chlamydia)
* 📊 Trend, seasonal, and residual component analysis

### 🧪 Epidemiological Modeling

* ⚙️ Implementation of **SIR (Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered)** model
* 🔁 Disease transmission dynamics simulation
* 📐 Parameter estimation (β, γ) for specific diseases

### 🏥 Public Health Policy Evaluation

* 🕰️ Before-and-after analysis of policy implementation
* 💉 Measles case study with 2009 policy evaluation
* 📉 Assessment of policy effectiveness on disease rates and counts
